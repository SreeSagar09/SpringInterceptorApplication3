A Simple Program to show how to configure Interceptor in Spring Application with HandlerInterceptor class:
Programs:
* AppConfig.java
* AppInit.java
* ActionHandlerController.java
* ActionHandlerInterceptor.java
Notes:
* The HandlerInterceptor is the root interceptor for all predefine and custom interctors in Spring.
* It has three default methods those are:
* default boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception
* default void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, @Nullable ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception
* default void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, @Nullable Exception ex) throws Exception
Output:
console output for this url: http://localhost:8080/SpringInterceptorApplication3/action/actionHandler1
From preHandle method in ActionHandlerInterceptor class
From actionHandler1 method in ActionHandlerController class
From postHandle method in ActionHandlerInterceptor class
From afterCompletion method in ActionHandlerInterceptor class
